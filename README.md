This is a satellite repository of Senior Design, its purpose is to make code upload to the rasberry pi easier. Since debugging is done on the rasberry pi after the code is pushed to github, this means a lot of back and forth. This independant repository is to avoid spamming the main repository and having an unfair representation of activity in the senior design repo. 

On succesful run of [test_keyboardMotor.py](test_keyboardMotor.py). expect a motor to move left when pushing once on left arrow and to move right when pushing on right arrow (WIP wont work)
On succesful run of [test_interruptMotor.py](test_interruptMotor.py), expect the motor to stop turning when ToF sensor detects an object that is too close. (WIP wont work)
