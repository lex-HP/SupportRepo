This is a satellite repository of Senior Design, its purpose is to make code upload to the rasberry pi easier. Since debugging is done on the rasberry pi after the code is pushed to github, this means a lot of back and forth. This independant repository is to avoid spamming the main repository and having an unfair representation of activity in the senior design repo.
